- [x] **Fix B/A button positioning** — The B and A action buttons are slightly conflicting with the game screen. Adjust `.action-btn` positioning/margins so they don't overlap or interfere with the canvas display. *(Fixed: added mt-3/mt-4 to push buttons down, reduced A button -mt-4 to -mt-3, added z-index to screen bezel, overflow:hidden on controls-area)*
